Roblox's FIRST ever seamless macro!
This is currently in BETA, and it is not done. So there may be bugs.

This macro uses Frame Fixing to record what the player does.
Because of this, your FPS matters, and could change the speed of the replay.
This may also trigger any anti-fly script put in place by the developper. This shouldn't be a big issue.
More recording mode may be added in the future.

# Instructions
Coming soon!
