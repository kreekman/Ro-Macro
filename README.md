Roblox's FIRST ever seamless macro!
You can record, replay, save, and share your files! Too lazy to come up with a name for your file? You can save your recording to a file dedicated to the Place ID!

Made a mistake in the middle of your macro? We got you covered!
Use the arrows to move your macro frame-by-frame (you can hold them), or type the frame value in the box!
Press the lock button to lock your character and your camera to any frame.
Once you're one the correct frame, just press record!

This macro uses Frame Fixing to record what the player does.
Because of this, your FPS matters, and could change the speed of the replay.
This may also trigger any anti-fly script put in place by the developper. This shouldn't be a big issue.
More recording mode may be added in the future.

This is currently in BETA, and it is not done. So there may be bugs.

Frame info tab coming soon!
